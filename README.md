# Vue-JS-Basic-Web-App

This web app has the basic functionality of typical blog websites - Adding a new blog and showing the posted ones.

The structuring was done using Vue JS (without much focus on UI).
The app interacts with firebase and can post and retrieve the data and add it dynamically to the app.
